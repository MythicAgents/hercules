## Summary

The `hercules` agent is a simple, bare-bones agent designed to show how to create a new agent from scratch as part of the SO-CON 2020 conference. This is not meant to be an agent used in operations.

### Highlighted Agent Features
The agent supports dynamic loading of commands and the ability to create an agent with only a subset of commands. The agent can also run powershell tasks, hook into a few Mythic features, and load 3rd party scripts.
